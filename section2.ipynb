I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area.\nAddresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim.\nData will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies  etc.\nThe procesing of these DATA will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
