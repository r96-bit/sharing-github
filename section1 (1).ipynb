I currently live within walking distance to a metro station and I enjoy ma ammenities and venues in the area, such as various international cousine restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment. I have been offered a great opportunity to work for a leader firm in Banglore. I am very excited and I want to use this opportunity to practice my learnings in Coursera in order to answer relevant questions arisen. The key question is : How can I find a convenient and enjoyable place similar to mine now in Mumbai? Certainly, I can use available real estate apps and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Banglore, I must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Banglore must meet the following demands:\n* desired location is near a metro station in the Banglorearea and within 1.0 mile (1.6 km) radius\n* price of rent not exceed 6,000 per month\n* top ammenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence\n\n**Business Problem:**\nThe challenge is to find a suitable apartment for rent in Banglore that complies with the demands on location, price and venues.
